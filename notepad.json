"respondent": {
  "is_text": true,
  "is_single": true,
  "path": ["div.news-body.news-teaser > div"],
  "regex": "In the Matter of (.*?):"
},

in this summary text
In the Matter of Mind Capital AKA Mind Capital OÜ AKA Mind Capital Tech SL; Gonzo Garcia-Pelayo; Oscar Garcia-Pelayo; Rubén Arcas; Manual Arniz; Cristina Kelly Lopez' Alejandro Mejía; and Craig Kintzel


A list of titles that are not coming back with the respondants name in the title.
Why is that.

is it because those summary texts include special characters?
like & and .
